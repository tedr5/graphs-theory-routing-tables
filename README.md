# Routing Tables

📖 **Description**

A C project for managing network graphs to determine routing tables for each node, implementing algorithms for connectivity verification and shortest path calculation.

⚙️ **Technologies**

- Language: C
- Graph Representation: Adjacency Matrix
- Visualization: Graphviz

🛠️ **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tedr5/graphs-theory-routing-tables.git
- Compile the C files.
- Run the application.

🚀 **Features**

- **Graph Storage:** Efficiently stores the network graph using an adjacency matrix.
- **Path Reconstruction:** Recovers the shortest path between nodes using predecessor matrices.
- **Connectivity Check:** Verifies network connectivity using a coloring algorithm.
- **Routing Table Calculation:** Computes the routing table for each node using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

📊 **Data Structures**

Utilizes an adjacency matrix for graph representation, a stack for path reconstruction, and additional matrices for times and predecessors.
